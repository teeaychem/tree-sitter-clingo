A [tree-sitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io) parser for [clingo-style ASP](https://potassco.org).

The grammar is feature complete with respect to [clingo v5.7.1](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases/tag/v5.7.1).
In particular, the grammar parses each example file from the clingo repository without error.
And, the grammar includes *correctness* tests for a smaller subset of example files.

The grammar has not been tested on nwever releases of clingo, though I do not know of significant changes.
